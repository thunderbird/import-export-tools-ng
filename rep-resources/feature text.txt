
ImportExportTools NG adds import and export functions for messages, folders and profiles.

This derivative add-on is the update of the original work of Paolo "Kaosmos", ImportExportTools.
The add-on is being updated for Thunderbird 68 (and 60) so that users can continue to enjoy the
functionality of this great add-on.

The first NG release, 4.0.0 , is a fork of v3.3.2 of the original add-on with the same functionality.
The name and icon have been changed to differentiate from the original version.
